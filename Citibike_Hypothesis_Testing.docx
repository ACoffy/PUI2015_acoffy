1. Describe your idea
As observed in previous exercises with the Citibike data, there is an identifiable decrease in the ridership for customers during the weekend as opposed to usage during the week. The intent is to test whether this change is statistically significant from the expected value for weekend usage.

2. Turn the idea into a testable hypothesis. State your Null and alternate hypothesis
H0 – The number of total customers that use Citibike is the same during the weekend as it is during the week.
HA – The number of total customers that use Citibike will decrease during the weekend as opposed to during the week. 

Our tests will evaluate the statistical significance of any observed change by performing a chi-squared test as it will indicate the likelihood of whether the observations made are due to chance.  
 
6. Assess whether you can reject the Null Hypothesis
With a probability of 0.0, we can reject our null hypothesis as we have found that there is a statistically significant chance that the observed difference from the expected value cannot be achieved by a sampling variation.
