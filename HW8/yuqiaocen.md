#REVIEW - yuqiaocen

##CLARITY
The plot is understandable, with time, but clarity is highly dependent upon the viewer's familiarity with the data and analytical approaches. 

##ESTHETIC
The colors are ok but there is overlap with the "Analytic Regression" line and "hispanic" circle plot. That could cause some confusion. Also there could be some contention with the "black" plot group being given the color black.

##HONESTY
The plot is honest in its depiction of the relationship between male and female median income distributions.

##IMPROVEMENTS

For an increased general readability I would suggest removing some elements from the graph or enabling a toggle feature to turn off some elements. The graph as it stands is busy and can be confusing to a general audience. Also more mindful color choices can be made for the racial groups.
