you reviews were good 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
=================================

this is a tableau like visualization more than a plot

it is a little crowded (remember the rule of 7 elements max) but well organized, so still readable

the legend does not need the title legend

the cardinal pints cloud be indicated more elegantly and simply by 2 arrows 

the data shown is ambiguous and the legend does not help at all: less than 250 what? (crimes presumably but not clear) and what is the difference in what is plotted by points and colored areas?

poverty level and serious crimes labels miss units

the size scale with the three steps per unit is crowding the plot and it is redundant


NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
=================================

======
unmotivated empty space to the right

the choice of red single color is "aggressive" to the sight, which may or may not be the desired effect given context. but it is a color that does not comply well with color blindness, so if that is the desired effect it would be lost in 10% of the male population

axis labels a bit small

==========


this is a tableau style visualization, not a plot (in fact a full poster)

as a poster it probably works well. 

if considered as a visualization it is too busy, fonts are too small. 

lets take the bottom panels as the plot: most panels cannot actually be judged because at the resolution at which i get the plots the legends are not readable.

the maps seem very busy: the gray structure underlying the dots/areas is probably unnecessary

even at full res i cannot imagine that the plots on the right would have axis labels and tick labels large enough. there is a lot of empthy space on the left of the center right panel. probably it should be removed.

========

the plot is very busy. 

no point in starting at the negative range: remove the <0 space

two legends for the regression lines and the datapoints may be better: clearer less overwhelming

association of color to rage triggers preconceptions. since you have few categories shapes may be a better choice.
