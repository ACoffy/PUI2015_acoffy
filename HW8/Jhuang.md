#REVIEW - Jhuang

##CLARITY
This plot is easy to read.  It provides clear insight into how the flow of a highway relates to the speed of each vehicle lending to the identification of the degree of traffic.

##ESTHETIC
The colors are rather simplistic but work well with creating contrast and allowing for the identification of different dots when the clustering increases.

##HONESTY
The plot seems honest.

##IMPROVEMENTS

I would encourage the addition of gridlines to focus the association with axis values. Also reducing the size of the dots would be helpful when the clustering starts to distort the visibility.
