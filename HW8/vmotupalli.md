##REVIEW - vmotupalli

###CLARITY

The plot is understandable albeit quite involved. There is some issue with the font size in some regions which affects the readability of the plot altogether.

####AESTHETIC

The colors are good and are easily associated with important aspects of the plot. The plots on the right side are a bit cluttered and do more to convey a general idea of the information in lieu of a granular understanding.

####HONESTY

The plot seem honest and don't have any conflicting information.

####IMPROVEMENTS

Fonts should be increased in some regions to improve readability. The plots on the bottom right could be moved to another slide so that they can be shown separately at a larger size.
